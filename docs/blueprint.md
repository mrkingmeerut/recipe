## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant orange (#FF7F50), reminiscent of the call to action buttons and selected branding elements, evokes energy and warmth.
- Background color: Light orange (#FAEBD7), a subtle and desaturated shade of the primary, creates a warm, inviting backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted red (#CD5C5C) for secondary buttons and less prominent interactive elements; provides a gentle contrast without overpowering the orange palette.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, providing a modern and clean feel; 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, ensuring readability.
- Use food-related icons (e.g., utensils, plates, ingredients) in a simple, outline style to complement the fun and accessible theme.
- Implement a clean and spacious layout with clear visual hierarchy to make it easy for users to navigate recipes and vlogs.
- Subtle transitions and hover effects to enhance user engagement, such as scaling up recipe cards or fading in recipe details.
